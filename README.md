# Java Snake game (follow along code)

In this captivating project, I enthusiastically embarked on a journey to learn how to develop the snake game using Java. Eager to familiarize myself with this new programming language, I made a deliberate choice to follow an insightful tutorial that provided step-by-step instructions. As a newcomer to Java, I sought to quickly acclimate myself to its syntax and conventions, and replicating the code presented in the tutorial proved to be an effective approach.

Throughout the tutorial, I found immense joy and satisfaction in witnessing the game come to life. Observing the intricate mechanics and interactions of the snake, the food, and the game board left me in awe of the underlying logic and the clever design choices. It was a gratifying experience to witness the concerted efforts of various Java files harmoniously merging together to form a cohesive and functional project.

In conclusion, delving into the world of Java through the creation of the snake game was a rewarding and enlightening experience. Not only did it allow me to grasp the fundamentals of Java programming, but it also instilled in me a profound appreciation for the artistry and ingenuity involved in game development.
