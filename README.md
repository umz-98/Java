# Java Snake game (follow along code)

In this project I decided to follow along a tutorial on how to make the snake game on java. This was my first time using Java and I wanted to get used to the language quickly so I decided to replicate the code in the tutorial. I really enjoyed seeing how the game works and how the java files come together into a project.
